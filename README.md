# Para-Cerebellum

## Introduction to the tested cerebellum segmentation softs
### suit
main_pipeline_segmentation_suit show you an exemple to run the function pipeline_segmentation_suit.
You need to run Matlab and spm before be able to run pipeline_segmentation_suit.
### suiter
### cnn
### ceres

## Run segmentation processes and stored results.

## Derivative for a better segementation results visualisation
### What are the derivatives ?
the derivatives are visual tools to make an easier and better evaluation of segmentation generated by the softs. The derivative are "mask", "edge", and "dice".
"mask" is a folder that holds all the indiviual binary mask label generated by each soft. "edge" are the edge of the masks, it is usefull to see the diferences between boundaries in a displayer like fsleyes. "dice" is the dice score between each label of two software organised in a matrix.

### Output folders organisation :

original : The subfolder "original" contains the outputs generated by the soft. Files are not renamed.
derivative : The subfolder "derivative" contains the outputs post-processed by Para-Cerebellum useful for result visualisation. The files inside are renamed and                organised the same way for all the derivative subfolder. Subfolder inside Derivative are "mask", "edge", "dice", "visual".

* mask: the subfolder "mask" contains all the binary mask of all the label proposed by the soft. It contains subfolder "self" that contain the binary mask of the         original labels proposed by the soft and "vs$an_other_soft$" subfolder that contains the binary mask fused between two softs.
      for exemple suit proposed three labels for the vermis VII instead of cnn that proposed only one label for vermis VII, that's why the subfolder vsnn contains
      only the label V_VII.nii.  
      suit
          self
              V_CrusI.nii
              V_CrusII.nii
              V_VIIb.nii
          vscnn
          V_VII.nii
* edge: Same as the mask subfolder, edge is divided in "self" subfolder and other "vs_an_other_soft" subfolders. Each contains the edge of each binary file of              mask subfolders
* dice: The subfolder "dice" contains dice matrix that compare the dice score. 
* visual: The subfolder "visual" is an additional subfolder that contains additional screen.
